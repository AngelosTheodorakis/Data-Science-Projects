This is a project for Covid cases in Greece. I gathered data from many sources and combined them. I finally used choropleth maps, to plot the data and reach some conclusions. 
<br>
The last update I used on Covid cases and deaths was on 8 October 2020. However, if you run the code it should work for later updates. (It depends on the wikipedia site updates).<br>
Finally, the maps made the jupyter file large and I couldn't upload it to GitHub. That is why I used firefox to render the image and then I downloaded it so I could make it
appear in the notebook, just to get an idea of the map.
