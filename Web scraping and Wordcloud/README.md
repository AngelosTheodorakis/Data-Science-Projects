## [**Project - Web Scraping and Wordcloud using Python.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/Web%20scraping%20and%20Wordcloud/Web%20Scraping%20and%20Wordcloud%20.ipynb)
In this project we extracted data from a webpage and then used this data to create a Wordcloud and a DataFrame, both of which contained useful information. The webpage
used for our example, is an interesting music blog in WordPress. You can explore it [here](https://vaggelisrevolted.wordpress.com/).<br>
We extracted the following information for each post:<br>
<br>
* All the description texts
* The date the post created
* Title of the post
* YouTube link
<br>
Below you can see an example of the image we created with Wordcloud.<br>
