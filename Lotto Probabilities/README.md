# [Lotto probabilities](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/Lotto%20Probabilities/Lottery.ipynb)
In this project we focus on the 6/49 lottery (Lotto) and build functions to answer the following questions:

* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single or more tickets ticket?
* What is the probability of having exactly five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?
* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?
* Are some numbers more likely to appear, based on historical data?

Finally, we will collect [historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada, with drawings dating from 1982 to 2018. We will be able to compare our ticket against the historical lottery data in Canada and determine whether we would have ever won by now.
