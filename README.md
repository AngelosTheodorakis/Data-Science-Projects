# **Plots in R**
In this repositorie I've made some plots using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. So, I found a good opportunity to get my hands on this data.\
Although some of these plots already exist in the official report of the study, made by EKPA, I wanted to use R in order to make some plots more interesting. Specifically, I used the package 'ggplot2'.\
The official study report of EKPA where you can find more information is ........... , but in greek language.\
I've also uploaded the variable labels in a seperate file (Variable_Labels.md), in order for someone to know what the variables represent.\
Again, for more details on this study, please visit .........
