# **Study of EKPA - Plots in R using ggplot2**
In this project I've made some plots using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. So, I found a good opportunity to get my hands on this data.\
Below is a summary of the files I have uploaded:
- **Plots_Presentation.Rmd** is the code I used for the plots. 
- **Plots_Presentation.md** is the file containing the plots presentation.
- **Variable_Labels.md** contains all the variable labels, in order for someone to know what the variables represent.
