Below is a quick summary of some of the projects I keep in this repositorie.

## [**Project 1 - Study of EKPA.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/EKPA_Postgraduate_study)
Visualizations using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. A survey was organized, asking graduates of EKPA postgraduate programs questions about employment, satisfaction with their studies etc. Some interesting observations are the following:
- According to graduates, their postgraduate program didn't have a big impact on helping them land a job.
- Generally, the graduates were satisfied with their postgraduate program and they would reccomend it to others.

## [**Project 2 - Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors)
This is a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American
Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.\
This is a part of a project i did on Dataquest and I had the chance to work with some plots like histograms, scatterplots and barplots, in Jupyter notebooks.

## [**Project 3 - Titanic dataset.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Titanic_Dataset)
This is the famous Titanic dataset. I've downloaded the data from Kaggle and used logistic regression to predict if the passengers in the test set survived or not.
