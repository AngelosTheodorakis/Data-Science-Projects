# **Data Analysis Projects**
Below is a quick summary of some of the projects i keep in this repositorie.

## **Study of EKPA - Plots in R using ggplot2**
In this project I've made some plots using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. So, I found a good opportunity to get my hands on this data.\
Below is a summary of the files I have uploaded:
- **Plots_Presentation.Rmd** is the code I used for the plots. 
- **Plots_Presentation.md** is the file containing the plots presentation.
- **Variable_Labels.md** contains all the variable labels, in order for someone to know what the variables represent.

## Job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. (Based on Dataquest site)
This is a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American
Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.\
This is a part of a project i did on Dataquest and I had the chance to work with some plots like histograms, scatterplots and barplots, in Jupyter notebooks.\
Below is a summary of the files I have uploaded:
- **Basics.ipynb** is the file containing the plots presentation and also some observations.
- **recent-grads.csv** is the data I used, in csv format.

## Titanic dataset
This is the famous Titanic dataset. I've downloaded the data from Kaggle and used logistic regression to predict if the passengers in the test set survived or not.
