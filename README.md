# **Plots in R**
Here I've made some plots using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. So, I found a good opportunity to get my hands on this data. Although some of these plots already exist in the official report of the study, made by EKPA, I wanted to use R in order to make some plots more interesting. Specifically, I used the package "ggplot2". 
The official study report of EKPA where you can find more information is in this link ........... , but in greek language. 
I've also uploaded the variable labels in a seperate file , in order for someone to know what the numeric variables represent. 
Again, for more details on this study, please visit .........
