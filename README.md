Below is a quick summary of some of the projects I keep in this repositorie.

## [**Project 1 - Study of EKPA.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/EKPA_Postgraduate_study)
Visualizations using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. A survey was organized, asking graduates of EKPA postgraduate programs questions about employment, satisfaction with their studies etc. Some interesting observations are the following:
- According to graduates, their postgraduate program didn't have a big impact on helping them land a job.
- Generally, the graduates were satisfied with their postgraduate program and they would reccomend it to others.

## [**Project 2 - Analyzing NY High School Data (SAT results)**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Analyzing%20NY%20High%20School%20Data)
This is a project about New York City public schools, based on a Dataquest guided project. \
Gathered data from various datasets and combined them into a single dataframe. Below is a list of the datasets, which I have stored in the [schools](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Analyzing%20NY%20High%20School%20Data/schools) folder.

* SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
* School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
* Class size - Information on class size for each school
* AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
* Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
* Demographics - Demographic information for each school
* School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

### After combining the data, I did the following:
* Found which variables better correlate with SAT scores.
* Used *basemap toolkit* to plot SAT score and safety score values in NY map.

## [**Project 3 - Visualizing Earnings Based On College Majors.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors)
This is a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American
Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.\
This is a part of a project i did on Dataquest and I had the chance to work with some plots like histograms, scatterplots and barplots, in Jupyter notebooks.
- Performed visualisations using matplotlib library, primarly working in pandas.

## [**Project 3 - Titanic dataset.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Titanic_Dataset)
This is the famous Titanic dataset. I've downloaded the data from Kaggle.
- Conducted EDA.
- Used logistic regression to predict whether the passengers on the test set survived or not.
