# **Study of EKPA - Plots in R using ggplot2**
In this project I've made some plots using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. So, I found a good opportunity to get my hands on this data.\
Although some of these plots already exist in the official report of the study, made by EKPA, I wanted to use R in order to make some plots more interesting. Specifically, I used the package 'ggplot2'.\
Below is a summary of the files I have uploaded:
- [**Plots_Presentation.Rmd**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/EKPA_Postgraduate_study/Plots_presentation.Rmd) is the code I used for the plots. 
- [**Plots_Presentation.md**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/EKPA_Postgraduate_study/Plots_presentation.md) is the file containing the plots presentation.
- [**Variable_Labels.md**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/EKPA_Postgraduate_study/Variable_Labels.md) contains all the variable labels, in order for someone to know what the variables represent.
- **My_encoding.R** will contain the code for data analysis I intend to do for this study (Not ready yet). 

I have not uploaded the data I used, since I wasn't allowed to do so.
