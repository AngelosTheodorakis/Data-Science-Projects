# **Plots in R**
In this project I've made some plots using data from a recent study of *National and Kapodistrian University of Athens(EKPA)*, in which I was responsible for the study documentation. So, I found a good opportunity to get my hands on this data.\
Although some of these plots already exist in the official report of the study, made by EKPA, I wanted to use R in order to make some plots more interesting. Specifically, I used the package 'ggplot2'.\
Below is a summary of the files I have uploaded:
- **Plots_Presentation.Rmd** is the code I used for the plots. 
- **Plots_Presentation.md** is the file containing the plots presentation.
- **Variable_Labels.md** contains all the variable labels, in order for someone to know what the variables represent.
- **My_encoding.R** will contain the code for data analysis I intend to do for this study (Not ready yet).\
