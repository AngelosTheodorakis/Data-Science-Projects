## [**Covid cases and deaths in Greece.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/Covid-19_Greece/Covid_Greece.ipynb)
<br>
In this project I focused on the covid cases in Greece and did the following:
<br>
<br>

* I gathered data from many web sources and combined them.
* I used choropleth maps, to plot the data and reach some conclusions.
* Found some general statistics about the data.
<br>
The interactive maps made the jupyter file large when I plotted the on the notebook and I couldn't upload it to GitHub. That is why I used Firefox to render the image and then I downloaded it so I could make it appear in the notebook in 2D, just to get an idea of the map.<br>
Finally, the last update I used on Covid cases and deaths was on 8 October 2020. However, if you run the code it should work for later updates. (It depends on the wikipedia site updates).
