This is a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American
Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data.\
This is a part of a project i did on Dataquest and I had the chance to work with some plots like histograms, scatterplots and barplots, in Jupyter notebooks.\
Below is a summary of the files I have uploaded:
- [**Basics.ipynb**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors/Basics.ipynb) is the file containing the plots presentation and also some observations.
- [**recent-grads.csv**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/Visualizing%20Earnings%20Based%20On%20College%20Majors/recent-grads.csv) is the data I used, in csv format.
