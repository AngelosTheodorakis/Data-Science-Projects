This is a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American
Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. This is a part of a project i did on Dataquest and I had the chance to work with some plots 
like histograms, scatterplots and barplots, in Jupyter notebooks.
