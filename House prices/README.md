## [**Project 5 - House Prices: Prediction and Data analysis.**](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/master/House%20prices/House_Prices.md)
This dataset is from a Kaggle competition, so it challenges us to predict the final price of each home. There are 79 explanatory variables, describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. I did the following:

- Conducted *EDA* and data cleaning.
- Used *multiple regression* to predict the price of homes.
<br>
My Kaggle ranking was in the middle of the board. This is not bad, because I didn’t do feature engineering or some really complicated machine learning models here, however I managed to get a descent score just by cleaning the data (taking care of NA’s), running a multiple regression and using variable selection.
It is possible to get much better predictions with feature engineering, by making some new variables like Total number of Bathrooms, Adding ‘House Age’ variable, Binning the Neighborhood variable, Total Square Feet etc. <br>
I will return in the future and apply some new concepts, in order to make more accurate predictions.
