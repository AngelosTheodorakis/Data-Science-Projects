## Analyzing NY High School Data (SAT results)
This is a project about New York City public schools, based on a Dataquest guided project. \
Gathered data from various datasets and combined them into a single dataframe. Below is a list of the datasets, which I have stored in the [schools](https://github.com/AngelosTheodorakis/Data_Analysis_Projects/tree/master/Analyzing%20NY%20High%20School%20Data/schools) folder.

* SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
* School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
* Class size - Information on class size for each school
* AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
* Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
* Demographics - Demographic information for each school
* School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

### After combining the data, I did the following:
* Found which variables better correlate with SAT scores.
* Used *basemap toolkit* to plot SAT score and safety score values in NY map.
